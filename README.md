## Dummy Data Initialization

To simplify testing and meet assignment requirements:

- The system starts with predefined users:
  - 3 Admins
  - 3 Doctors
  - 3 Patients

Each user's ID, name, email, and phone number are displayed on console at program start. Users can log in using these credentials.

Note: The system is designed to be scalable to include:

- User registration and login
- Persistent storage (file or database)
- Graphical User Interface (JavaFX)

## User Experience

- Console-based interface
- No forced program termination without user consent
- All inputs are guided with clear prompts
- Input mismatches are handled gracefully with reusable utility methods
